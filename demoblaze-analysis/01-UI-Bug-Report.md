Title: [UI] Empty Cart Table Lacks Side Margins

Steps to Reproduce:
  Navigate to the homepage: https://www.demoblaze.com/
  Ensure the shopping cart is empty (start a new session).
  Click on the "Cart" link in the main navigation bar.
  Observe the alignment of the table that is displayed.

Expected Result: The cart's content table (with the "Title", "Price", etc. columns) should be displayed with a left margin, aligning with the rest of the page's elements to maintain visual consistency.
Actual Result: The table appears completely flush with the left edge of the page, without any margin. This breaks the design's consistency and appears visually incorrect.
