Title: [UI] "Delete Messages" button text is truncated in the "Notifications" tab

Platform: DiDi Mobile App (Android)

Steps to Reproduce:
1.- Open the DiDi application on an Android device.
2.- Navigate to "My Profile" and then to "Messages".
3.- Select the "Notification" tab.
4.- Observe the text option at the top of the message list.

Actual Result: The text for the "Eliminar todos los mensajes no le√≠dos" (Delete all unread messages) option is too long for its UI container and is displayed as truncated, ending with an ellipsis (...).

Expected Result: The text should be fully visible to avoid compromising the app's clarity and aesthetics. The suggested solution is to shorten the text to a more direct phrase that fits the designated space, such as "Clear Unread" or "Clear Notifications".
